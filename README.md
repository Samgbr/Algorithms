# Algorithms

In this repository I have implemented different algorithms using dynamic programming and other methods.

##### Formal Language and Automaton

+ CNF (Chmosky Normal Form) for Context-free Languages: This Python code receives the grammar in a dictionary and use the a dynamic programming CKY algorithm to fill matrix (tabulation) using a cartesian product of the derivatives of the grammar rules.
+ Element Distinct Problem: This python code receives a string in the format X1#X2#X3#X4% and checks if each Xi is distinct from the rest.
+ CNF Resolution: accepts a conjunctive normal form formula and perform a resolution to the formula and checks if it is satisfiable or not.
##### Sorting Algorithm
+ K-Way Merge Sort: K-Way merge sort is a sorting algorithm that split the original array in to k-Arrays and sort each k-Array using quicksort. Then 2-way iterative merge (at a time two k-arrays will be merged iteratively not recursively) and sort the list using quicksort until all k-arrays merged in to one sorted array.  
  
Other Codes will be implemented later.
