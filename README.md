# Algorithms

In this repository I have implemented different algorithms using dynamic programming and other methods.

### Formal Language and Automaton

1. CNF (Chmosky Normal Form) for Context-free Languages.
  This Python code receives the grammar in a dictionary and use the CKY algorithm to fill matrix using a 
  cartesian product of the derivatives of the grammar rules.
2. Element Distinct Problem
  This python code receives a string in the format X1#X2#X3#X4# and checks if each Xi is distinct from the rest.
  
 Other Codes will be implemented later.
